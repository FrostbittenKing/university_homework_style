University Homework Custom Style
================

This is my custom Latex style for my Vienna University of Technology Homework assignments.
It loads the article class and adds a custom titlepage, and modifies some default changes.

For ease of use, this style also provides a simple example and a Makefile.

How to use the style:
 * copy all the package files(sty), style files(cls) and the file titlepageTemplate.tex to your home texmf directory(~/texmf/tex/latex/assignment-university)
 * run texhash ./ on ~/texmf to generate the ls-R file
 * start off with the simpleExample.tex file
